This project consists of algorithms to interconvert prefix,infix,and postfix notations.
Prefix: For example, the first line in the prefixinput.txt file "++A-*^BCD/+EF*GHI" will be converted to both infix and postfix notation using the stack algorithm. The outputs should be "A+B^C*D-E+F/G*H+I" and "ABC^D*EF+GH*/-+I+".
Postfix: For example, the first line in the postfixinput.txt file "AB+C-" will be converted to both infix and postfix notation using the stack alorithm. The outputs should be "A+B-C" and "-+ABC".
Infix: The alorithm will first convert and infix expression into postfix, and then convert that postfix expression into a prefix expression. For example the first line in InfixInputs.txt file "(A+B)*(C^(D-E)+F)-G" will be converted to "-*+AB+^C-DEFG".

To run this code unzip the file on your machine and save all the files in the same directory.
